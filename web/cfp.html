        <p class="my-2 max-w-xl text-base">The Open Transport Community Conference is an <a class="border-b border-dotted" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">Unconference</a>. That is, the final session schedule will only be put together at the event itself. In order to prepare and allow people to see possible topics, we are nevertheless already collecting suggestions for sessions.</p>

        <p class="my-2 max-w-xl text-base">Unlike for conventional talks you don't need to be a domain expert to suggest a session, and you are not expected to fill the session with a prepared presentation. Suggesting a topic you want to learn more about and hope to find others to learn from at the conference is also perfectly valid. Helping with leading/moderating the discussion and/or taking notes would be appreciated though.</p>

        <p class="my-2 max-w-xl text-base">Session slots are 60 minutes long. Depending on the demand overlapping or adjacent topics might have to be combined.</p>

        <ul class="my-2 max-w-xl text-base list-disc list-inside">Possible topics include but are by no means limited to:
            <li>Schedule data, including data formats, data quality, tooling, QA as well as uses and lobby/outreach work for getting more data published.</li>
            <li>Shared and on-demand mobility data.</li>
            <li>Routing for all kinds of modalities, including engines, algorithms and APIs.</li>
            <li>Accessibility in public transport, including routing profiles, indoor routing, data standards and modeling and elevator status data.</li>
            <li>Passenger-facing applications around public transport and mobility usecases.</li>
            <li>Transit data analysis and research supporting passenger-facing usecases.</li>
            <li>Operations of open source public transport routing services.</li>
            <li>Digital tickets beyond proprietary platforms.</li>
            <li>Open source solutions for community-run mobility services.</li>
            <li>Geocoding.</li>
            <li>OpenStreetMap (OSM), including tagging schemas, data importing and upstream collaboration.</li>
            <li>Collaboration between public transport operators/agencies and the Open Transport community.</li>
            <li>Community work, such as local events/meetups.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="my-4 max-w-xl text-base">For all of this keep in mind the "Open" part of the event, that is data and software covered here should be openly available for everyone.</p>
