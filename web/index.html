                We are a group of people working on different transport-related open-source and open-data
                projects. With this conference we want to create a space to connect with others working in the
                same area, to have time for exchange, learning from each other, starting collaborations.

               Anyone who works in public transport, either on your free time or commercially, who is open to open
               source and open data.

                We are still working out the details of the conference program. But we do already know that we
                want this to be an <b>unconference</b>, rather than a traditional conference.

            <p class="mb-2 text-center max-w-xl text-base">
                This means less focus on talks and more on exchange and discussion. And we'll have participants play a big
                roll in deciding which topics/sessions/workshops will feature in the program. There will likely be sessions for
                lightning talks and maybe one or two standard talks, as well.
