                The Open Transport Community Conference intends to bring people
                together from all areas of Open Transport and to provide
                discussions on topics, that are often neglected by similar events.
                Therefore this event is for everyone, who works in Open Transport,
                either voluntary or commercial, and wants to design and improve
                existing solutions.
            </p>

            <p class="my-4 text-center max-w-xl text-base">
                The event was created, as opportunities for exchange with other
                peoples in the community were limited on other conferences.
