## Who are we?

We are a group of people working on different transport-related open-source and open-data
projects. With this conference we want to create a space to connect with others working in the
same area, to have time for exchange, learning from each other, starting collaborations.

## Who is this event for?

Anyone who works in public transport, either on your free time or commercially, who is open to open
source and open data.

## What to expect?

This will be an <b>unconference</b>, rather than a traditional conference.

This means less focus on talks and more on exchange and discussion. And we'll have participants play a big
roll in deciding which topics/sessions/workshops will feature in the program.

See the <a href="#schedule">conference schedule</a> below for more details.

## Schedule

{{% schedule %}}

[^hello]:  Hi! Settle in and get comfortable :-). We'll try to have all the session proposal that have been submitted before the conference printed out and up on a wall, so that you have a chance to already read up on what is going to happen.

[^pitches]: Everybody that wants to propose a session is invited to the stage for a very short (1 min HARD limit) session pitch. We would like to hear from those that already submitted a session idea before the conference, of course, but please also come up if you had some spontaneous idea for a session!

[^schedule]: We'll probably do dot voting to gauge interest for the different proposals and then will create the schedule together on the board. We'll leave some empty slots on the second day for those session ideas that come out of the first conference day.

[^session]: Each session slot is 60 minutes. How you fill this time is up to you and your session group. You could have a big group discussion, you could split up in different breakout groups and come together again at the end, you could have one person sharing their knowledge or all try to solve some specific problem together. We would love if you could take some notes of the discussion and/or results for those that could not attend that session and post those notes to our github discussions page.

[^lighting]: There will be a sign-up paper sheet, first come first serve.
